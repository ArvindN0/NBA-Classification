# NBA Classification, Abstract
This project used multiple classification methods to investigate whether an NBA player’s season statistics can be used to ascertain the position they play. The aim was to predict a player’s position in the 2022-2023 season based on training data from the prior 21 seasons. We applied support vector machines (SVMs), tree-based bagging, artificial neural networks, and developed a hybrid SVM-tree model to overcome the limitations of typical decision trees. A filter method was applied to identify relevant predictors across the models and k-fold cross validation was used across all models for hyperparameter tuning. After training on 2001-2021 data, models were tested on the test set of the 2022-2023 NBA season. Test results showed that the support vector machine with a linear kernel performed the worst, while the hybrid model and artificial neural network approaches were the best performing models—successfully classifying 83.1% of player positions for the 2022-2023 NBA season. While the training and hyperparameter tuning process for the latter methods were more computationally intensive, they resulted in better performance on both the training and test sets.
